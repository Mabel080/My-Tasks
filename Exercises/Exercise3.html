    <title>Exercise Three: Conditionals</title>

<body>
<!-- 1. ODD/EVEN NUMBER
   Write an if...else statement that:
	prints "even" if the number is an even number
	prints "odd" if the number is an odd number

<script>

let number = parseInt(prompt("Enter any Number: "), 10);

function EvenOdd(number) {
    if (number % 2 === 0) {
        return "Even";
    } else {
        return "Odd";
    }
}

alert("The number is " + EvenOdd(number));

</script>

<!-- 2. MUSICAL TONE
Write a series of conditional statements that:
●	Prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
●	Prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1
●	Prints "duet" if musicians is equal to 2
●	Prints "trio" if musicians is equal to 3
●	Prints "quartet" if musicians is equal to 4
●	Prints "this is a large group" if musicians is greater than 4


<script>

let musician = 7;

function tone(musician) {
    if (musician <= 0) {
        return "Not a group";

<!-- 3. MURDER MYSTERY
you're going to help solve a fictitious murder mystery that happened at Stutern! 
A murder mystery is a game typically played at parties wherein one of the partygoers 
is secretly, and unknowingly, playing a murderer, and the other attendees must determine 
who among them is the criminal. It's a classic case of whodunnit.

To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:
1.	sets the value of weapon based on the room and
2.	sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room

<script>

let room = "Dining Room"; 
let suspect = "Mr. Parkes";

let weapon;
let solved = false;

if (room === "Ballroom") {
    weapon = "Poison";
} else if (room === "Gallery") {
    weapon = "Trophy";
} else if (room === "Billiard Room") {
    weapon = "Pool Stick";
} else if (room === "Dining Room") {
    weapon = "Knife";
}


if ((room === "Dining Room" && suspect === "Mr. Parkes") ||
    (room === "Gallery" && suspect === "Ms. Van Cleve") ||
    (room === "Billiards Room" && suspect === "Mrs. Sparr") ||
    (room === "Ballroom" && suspect === "Mr. Kalehoff")) {
    solved = true;
}

if (solved) {
    alert(`${suspect} did it in the ${room} with the ${weapon}!`);
} else {
    alert("The mystery is not solved yet.");
}

</script>

<!-- 4. CHECK BALANCE
<script>

let checkBalance = true; 
let isActive = true;       
let balance = 325.00;          

if (checkBalance) {
    if (isActive && balance > 0) {
        alert("Your balance is $" + balance + ".");
    } else if (!isActive) {
        alert("Your account is no longer active.");
    } else if (balance === 0) {
        alert("Your account is empty.");
    } else {
        alert("Your balance is negative. Please contact bank.");
    }
} else {
    alert("Thank you. Have a nice day!");
}

</script>

<!-- 5. ICECREAM ORDER
 Ice cream is one of the most versatile desserts on the planet because it can be done up so 
 many different ways. Using logical operators, write a series of complex logical expressions that 
 prints only if the following conditions are true:

●	if flavor is set to vanilla or chocolate and
●	if vessel is set to cone or bowl and
●	if toppings is set to sprinkles or peanuts
If the above conditions are true, then print out:

I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________.

<script>

let flavor = "vanilla"; 
let vessel = "cone";   
let toppings = "sprinkles";

if (
    (flavor === "vanilla" || flavor === "chocolate") &&
    (vessel === "cone" || vessel === "bowl") &&
    (toppings === "sprinkles" || toppings === "peanuts")
) {
    alert(`I'd like two scoops of ${flavor} ice cream in a ${vessel} with ${toppings}.`);
}

</script>

<!-- 6. CLOTH SIZES
Use the sizing chart above, create a series of logical expressions that prints the size of a 
t-shirt based on the measurements of shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. 
Valid sizes include S, M, L, XL, 2XL, and 3XL.

<script>
var shirtWidth = 19;  
var shirtLength = 28;    
var shirtSleeve = 8.21;

if (
    shirtWidth >= 18 && shirtWidth <= 19 &&
    shirtLength === 28 &&
    shirtSleeve >= 8.13 && shirtSleeve <= 8.38
) {
    alert("S");
} else if (
    shirtWidth >= 20 && shirtWidth <= 22 &&
    shirtLength === 29 &&
    shirtSleeve >= 8.38 && shirtSleeve <= 8.63
) {
    alert("M");
} else if (
    shirtWidth >= 22 && shirtWidth <= 24 &&
    shirtLength === 30 &&
    shirtSleeve >= 8.63 && shirtSleeve <= 8.88
) {
    alert("L");
} else if (
    shirtWidth >= 24 && shirtWidth <= 26 &&
    shirtLength === 31 &&
    shirtSleeve >= 8.88 && shirtSleeve <= 9.63
) {
    alert("XL");
} else if (
    shirtWidth >= 26 && shirtWidth <= 28 &&
    shirtLength === 33 &&
    shirtSleeve >= 9.63 && shirtSleeve <= 10.13
) {
    alert("2XL");
} else if (
    shirtWidth >= 28 && shirtWidth <= 30 &&
    shirtLength === 34 &&
    shirtSleeve >= 10.13 && shirtSleeve <= 10.38
) {
    alert("3XL");
} else {
    alert("N/A");
}

</script>

<!-- 7. CONSUMER-BASED CATEGORIES
Write a series of ternary statements that sets the variable category equal to:
●	"herbivore" if an animal eats plants
●	"carnivore" if an animal eats animals
●	"omnivore" if an animal eats plants and animals
●	"undefined" if an animal doesn't eat plants or animals
Use the eatsPlants and eatsAnimals variables to test your code.

<script>

let eatsPlants = true;
let eatsAnimals = false;

let category = eatsPlants && eatsAnimals ? "omnivore" :
               eatsPlants ? "herbivore" :
               eatsAnimals ? "carnivore" :
               "undefined";

alert(category);

</script>

<!-- 8. SALARY OUTCOME
Write a switch statement to set the average salary of a person based on their type of completed education.
Afterwards, print the following to the console.
In 2015, a person with __________ earned an average of __________/year.

<script>

let education = "no high school diploma";
let salary;

switch (education) {
    case "no high school diploma":
        salary = 25636;
        break;
    case "high school diploma":
        salary = 35256;
        break;
    case "Associate's degree":
        salary = 41496;
        break;
    case "Bachelor's degree":
        salary = 59124;
        break;
    case "Master's degree":
        salary = 69732;
        break;
    case "Professional degree":
        salary = 89960;
        break;
    case "Doctoral degree":
        salary = 84396;
        break;
    default:
        salary = "unknown";
}

if (typeof salary === "number") {
    salary = salary.toLocaleString("en-US");
}

alert(`In 2015, a person with ${education} earned an average of $${salary} per year.`);
