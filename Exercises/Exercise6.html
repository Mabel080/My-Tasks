<body>
<!-- 1. SOFTWARE ENGINEERING STUDENT
 Create an array called softwareEngineeringStudents and add 10 students from your class in the array. 
Then, print the softwareEngineeringStudents to the console using console.log.
    
<script>
    var softwareEngineeringStudents = ["Maybel","Endy","Jingle Bell","Sommy","Jago","Remi","Ola","Iyebiye","ShortBoy","Man of the 60s"];
    let space =  softwareEngineeringStudents.join(' , ');
    alert(space); 
</script>
-->

<!-- 2. BUILDING THE CREW
 Create an array called crew to organize the Serenity’s crew and set it equal to the variables below . You don't need to type out the actual strings, just use the provided variables.

let captain = "Mal";
let second = "Zoe";
let pilot = "Wash";
let companion = "Inara";
let mercenary = "Jayne";
let mechanic = "Kaylee";
Then, print the crew array to the console.


<script>
    let captain = "Mal";
    let second = "Zoe";
    let pilot = "Wash";
    let companion = "Inara";
    let mercenary = "Jayne";
    let mechanic = "Kaylee";

    let crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];

    let spaces = crew.join(', ');
    alert(spaces);
</script>
-->

<!-- 3. UPDATING PRICES
 Starting with this array of prices, change the prices of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th elements in the array.
const prices = [1.23, 48.11, 90.11, 8.50, 9.99, 1.00, 1.10, 67.00];
TIP: The 1st element of any array has an index of 0.
Afterwards, print out the prices array to the console.


<script>
    const prices = [1.23, 48.11, 90.11, 8.50, 9.99, 1.00, 1.10, 67.00];
    prices[0] = 45.23;
    prices[2] = 4.23;
    prices[6] = 5.23;
    let spaces = prices.join(', ');
    alert(spaces);
</script>

<!-- 4. COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
 James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Indigo", "Violet"];

but James had this:

const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];

Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" by following these steps:

1.	Remove "Blackberry"
2.	Add "Yellow" and "Green"
3.	Add "Indigo" and "Violet"


<script>
    const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];
    rainbow.splice(2,1,"Yellow", "Green");
    rainbow.splice(rainbow.length, 0, "Indigo", "Violet");
    let spaces = rainbow.join(', ');
    alert(spaces);
</script>

<!-- 5. QUIDDITCH CUP
 Consider the following array.

const team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];

Create a function called hasEnoughPlayers() that takes the team array as an argument and returns true or false
depending on if the array has at least seven players.


<script>

const team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
function hasEnoughPlayers(team) {
    if (team.length >= 7) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
alert(hasEnoughPlayers(team))

</script>
-->

<!-- 6. JOINING THE CREW
 In an earlier exercise, you created a crew array to represent Mal’s crew from the hit show Firefly.

let captain = "Mal";
let second = "Zoe";
let pilot = "Wash";
let companion = "Inara";
let mercenary = "Jayne";
let mechanic = "Kaylee";

const crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];

Later in the show, Mal takes on three new crew members named "Simon", "River", and "Book". Use the push() method to add the three new crew members to the crew array.

let doctor = "Simon";
let sister = "River";
let shepherd = "Book";


<script>
    let captain = "Mal";
    let second = "Zoe";
    let pilot = "Wash";
    let companion = "Inara";
    let mercenary = "Jayne";
    let mechanic = "Kaylee";

    let crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];

    let doctor = "Simon";
    let sister = "River";
    let shepherd = "Book";

    crew.push(doctor, sister, shepherd)

    let spaces = crew.join(', ');
    alert(spaces);
</script>
-->

<!-- 7. USING FOREACH()
 Use the array's forEach() method to loop over the following array and add 100 to each of the values 
 if the value is divisible by 3.
 const test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4, 19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299, 6, 109, 
 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139];


<script>
const test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4, 19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299, 6, 109, 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139];

test.forEach(function(num, index){
    if (num % 3 === 0) {
        test[index] += 100;
    }
});
let space = test.join(' , ')
alert(space);
</script>
-->

<!-- 8. USING MAP()
Use the map() method to take the array of bill amounts shown below, and create a second array of numbers called
totals that shows the bill amounts with a 15% tip added.

const bills = [50.23, 19.12, 34.01, 100.11, 12.15, 9.90, 29.11, 12.99, 10.00, 99.22, 102.20, 100.10, 6.77, 2.22];
Print out the new totals array using console.log.


<script>
const bill = [50.23, 19.12, 34.01, 100.11, 12.15, 9.90, 29.11, 12.99, 10.00, 99.22, 102.20, 100.10, 6.77, 2.22];

const total = bill.map(function(bill) {
    let totalWithTip = bill * 1.15;
    return parseFloat(totalWithTip.toFixed(2));
});
let space = total.join(' ,  ')
alert(space);
</script>
-->

<!-- 9. NESTED FOR LOOP
 Use a nested for loop to take the numbers array below and replace all of the values that are divisible by 2 
 (even numbers) with the string "even" and all other numbers with the string "odd".

<script>
const numbers = [
   [243, 12, 23, 12, 45, 45, 78, 66, 223, 3],
   [34, 2, 1, 553, 23, 4, 66, 23, 4, 55],
   [67, 56, 45, 553, 44, 55, 5, 428, 452, 3],
   [12, 31, 55, 445, 79, 44, 674, 224, 4, 21],
   [4, 2, 3, 52, 13, 51, 44, 1, 67, 5],
   [5, 65, 4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 43, 23, 4424],
   [74, 532, 6, 7, 35, 17, 89, 43, 43, 66],
   [53, 6, 89, 10, 23, 52, 111, 44, 109, 80],
   [67, 6, 53, 537, 2, 168, 16, 2, 1, 8],
   [76, 7, 9, 6, 3, 73, 77, 100, 56, 100]
];
for (let r = 0; r < numbers.length; r++) {
  let rowStr = "";
  for (let c = 0; c < numbers[r].length; c++) {
    if (numbers[r][c] % 2 === 0) {
      rowStr += "even".padEnd(8, " ");
    } else {
      rowStr += "odd".padEnd(8, " ");
    }
  }
  alert(rowStr.trim());
}

</script>

<!-- 10. THEORITICAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

(a.) Use the MDN Documentation to determine which of these methods would be best for reversing elements in this array:
const reverseMe = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"];
    1.	pop()
    2.	push()
    3.	reverse()
    4.	shift()
    5.	splice()

ANSWER: From the above we can say that the best method for reversing elements is the reverse(), because pop()
        removes from the end, push() add to the end, shift() removes the first element in the array
        and lastly, splice() is used to add or remove from any part of the array. Therefore having considered all the available options,
        our best chances of reversing the array is using the reverse() method.

(b.) What would be the best array method to sort the elements in this array:
const sortMe = [2, 1, 10, 7, 6];
   1. concat()
   2. join()
   3. unshift()
   4. sort()
   5. organize()

ANSWER: The best array method to sort the elements is the sort() method because every other method here performs
        different functions apart from the organize() method which does not exist in Javascript.

(c.) Consider the following array, removeFirstElement:
var removeFirstElement = ["a", "b", "c"];
Let's say that you want to modify (i.e., mutate) removeFirstElement by removing the first element within it. Which method(s) could you use?
   1. pop()
   2. push()
   3. shift()
   4. unshift()
   5. splice()
   6. slice()

ANSWER: The best array method to modify by removing the first element is the shift() method.

(d.) What method would be best for changing this array into a string?
const turnMeIntoAString = ["U", "d", "a", "c", "i", "t", "y"];
1.	join()
2.	concat()
3.	fill()
4.	copyWithin()

ANSWER: The best array method for changing this array to a string is the join() method which return a new string
        by concatinating all elements in the array.
