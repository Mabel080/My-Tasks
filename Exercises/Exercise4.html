<!-- 1. FIZZBUZZ
     Write a while loop that:
●	Loop through the numbers 1 to 20
●	If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
●	If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
●	If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
●	If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

<script>
let i = 1;

while (i <= 20) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    alert("FizzBuzz");
  }
  else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    alert("Fizz");
  }
  else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    alert("Buzz");
  }
  else {
    alert(i);
  }
  
  i++;
}

<!-- 2. 99 BOTTLES OF JUICE
Write a loop that prints out the following song. Starting at 99, and ending at 1 bottle.
99 bottles of juice on the wall! 99 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 98 bottles of juice on the wall!
98 bottles of juice on the wall! 98 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 97 bottles of juice on the wall!
...
2 bottles of juice on the wall! 2 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 1 bottle of juice on the wall!
1 bottle of juice on the wall! 1 bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 0 bottles of juice on the wall!


<script>
let bottles = 5;

while (bottles > 0) {
  alert(bottles + " bottles of juice on the wall! " + bottles + " bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... " + (bottles - 1) + " bottles of juice on the wall!");

  bottles--;

  if (bottles === 1) {
    alert(bottles + " bottle of juice on the wall! " + bottles + " bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... " + (bottles - 1) + " bottles of juice on the wall!");
    break;
  }
}

<!-- 3. NASA'S COUNTDOWN TO LAUNCH
NASA's countdown to launch includes checkpoints where NASA engineers complete certain technical tasks. During the final minute, NASA has 6 tasks to complete:
●	Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power (T-50 seconds)
●	Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start (T-31 seconds)
●	Activate launch pad sound suppression system (T-16 seconds)
●	Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system (T-10 seconds)
●	Main engine start (T-6 seconds)
●	Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff! (T-0 seconds)


<script>
let countdown = 50;

while (countdown >= 0) {
  switch (countdown) {
    case 50:
      alert("Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power (T-50 seconds)");
      break;
    case 31:
      alert("Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start (T-31 seconds)");
      break;
    case 16:
      alert("Activate launch pad sound suppression system (T-16 seconds)");
      break;
    case 10:
      alert("Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system (T-10 seconds)");
      break;
    case 6:
      alert("Main engine start (T-6 seconds)");
      break;
    case 0:
      alert("Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff! (T-0 seconds)");
      break;
    default:
      console.log("T-" + countdown + " seconds");
  }
  countdown--;
}

<!-- 4. HELLO USING FOR LOOP
Rewrite the following while loop as a for loop:
var x = 9;
while (x >= 1) {
  console.log("hello " + x);
  x = x - 1;
}

<script>
for(let x = 9; x >= 1; x = x-1){
    alert("Hello " + x)
}

</script>
-->

<!-- 5. 
Here is a for loop that's supposed to print the numbers 5 through 9. Fix the error!
for (x < 10; x++) {
  console.log(x);
}

<script>

for(let x = 5; x < 10; x++){
    alert(x)
}

</script>
-->

<!-- 6. 
The for loop below has an error. Fix it!
for (let k = 0 k < 200 k++) {
  console.log(k);
}

<script>

for (let k = 0; k < 200; k++) {
  alert(k);
}

</script>
-->

<!-- 7. FACTORIAL OF 12 
Write a for (note: not a function) loop that prints out the factorial of the number 12:

<script>

let factorial = 1;
let calculation = "";

for (let i = 12; i >= 1; i--) {
  factorial *= i;
  
  if (i === 1) {
    calculation += i; 
  } else {
    calculation += i + " * ";
  }
}

alert("12! = " + calculation + " = " + factorial);

</script>

<!-- 8. THEATRE SIT COUNT 

Theatre seats often display a row and seat number to help theatre goers find their seats. 
If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99) in each row, write a nested for loop 
to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theatre.

<script>

for (let row = 0; row < 26; row++) {
  for (let seat = 0; seat < 100; seat++) {
    alert("Row " + row + ", Seat " + seat);
  }
}
